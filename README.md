# Automating-EDA

### Introduction
EDA is one of the most important parts of any data science life cycle. It gives us a clear understanding of the data. With the help of python libraries such as “Matplotlib”, “seaborn”, “plotly”, we can create many insightful visualizations within the python environment. However, most of the time beginners have no idea where to start from. In that time Automating Exploratory Data Analysis comes into the picture. Furthermore, understanding the whole dataset properly requires many steps, and automating this whole process can save a lots of time.
There are many python libraries available that can automate this whole process.
- Pandas Profiling
- Sweetviz
- Autoviz
- Dtale
- Lux
